                    What might be hiding in some ordinary things you might see on the ground? 
                    Here are some objects that were found right on Vassarâ€™s campus. 
                    Select a sample to observe under the SEM!

                    This is a close-up image of a dead leaf captured by the SEM. Each inch shows only 50 micrometers, 
                    which is about the width of a hair. Various cellular structures and different layers of the epidermis 
                    are visible here: The left shows the spongy layer of the leaf that makes up the inside, and the right 
                    shows the bottom of the outside of the leaf. Oval shaped holes are stomata, or openings for the leaf to 
                    release gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SEM also can tell us what elements make up this image. The bright white clusters are important 
                    nutrients that may have been compartmentalized in the leaf and used for cellular processes. Some of the 
                    nutrients visible in clusters are Manganese, Silicon, and Calcium.

                    This SEM captured this close-up image of a mushroom. The entire image is about 800 micrometers across, 
                    which is the size of a few grains of sand. The image shows microscopic folds under a mushroom cap called
                    lamanae.

                <p>
                    The SEM also can tell us what elements make up this image. Oxygen, Potassium, Phosphorus, and Calcium 
                    are some examples of elements that are distributed homogeneously across the image, and are often indicative 
                    of organic material.

                    This SEM image shows the surface of a shard of stained glass. Each inch in this 
                    image is 100 micrometres, which is about the size of the largest cell in your body. This is a piece of 
                    oddly-shaped debris caught in a ridge in the glass. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SEM also can tell us what elements make up this image. Silicon and Oxygen, which are the major components
                    of glass, show up in the lighter colored parts of this image. The darker parts of the image show elements that 
                    are indicative of organic matter, such as Potassium, Calcium, and Oxygen.

                <p>
                    The SEM took this image of the spot just next to the bug that is being observed. 
                    Each inch in this image is only 50 micrometers, which is about the width of a piece of hair.
                    These are microscopic mites which likely had a parasitic relationship with their host organism.
